An XML specification to describe your virtual personae.

----------

Avatar here is a word used to describe the physical characteristics of player character (or "toon") in a video game or
other environment in which a virtual persona would prove beneficial. It does not refer to a user icon, as one might see
on a blogging site, or through something like Gravatar or Libravatar.
